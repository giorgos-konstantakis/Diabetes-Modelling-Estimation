Development of a Linear Kalman Filter for observing the response of a diabetic type-1 subject throughout the day

The purpose of this project is to develop a method with which a hospital patient could be easily taken care of in unpleasant situations ( such as having
an extremely low blood glucose concentration ) in order to inform the doctors immediately , through the use of sensors which are applied in the surface of
the body of the patient , using 5G technologies . For that reason , we developed a Linear Kalman Filter for estimating the blood glucose concentration of
the patient at any given time , calculating the distance between the true values and the model . In the file there are all the necessary functions and 
instructions to do so .
